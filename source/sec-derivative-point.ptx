    <title>Definition of the Derivative</title>
    <p>
     In this video we define the derivative at a point, translating a geometric problem about secant lines approaching a tangent line into a precise limit definition of the derivative.</p>

    <title>Derivative of a function </title>
    <p>
      In this video we show how to extend from thinking about the derivative <em>at a point</em> to the derivative <em>of a function</em>. We apply this to the specific function <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{x}</m>.

     At the end we just “plugged in” h = 0 when evaluating the limit. Why didn’t we do that earlier?

    <title>Derivative of a Constant and x^2 </title>
    <p>
    Let's start applying the definition of the derivative to some of the simplest functions, like a constant function and the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>. </p>
