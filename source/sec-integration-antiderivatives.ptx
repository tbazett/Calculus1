    <title>Antiderivatives</title>
    <p>
    We've seen many differentiation rules like the power rule. But can we go in reverse? Given a function like f(x), can we find a function whose derivative is f(x)? In this first video we focus specifically on undoing the power rule and the distinction between an anti-derivative and the general anti-derivative. </p>

    <title>Initial Value Problems</title>
    <p>
     We expand the types of functions we take anti-derivatives and solve "Initial Value Problems".
