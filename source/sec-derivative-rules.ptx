    <title>Derivitive Rules for Sums, Constant Multiples, and Powers</title>
    <p>
     In this video we'll derive our first derivative rules which we will use over and over again for sums, multiplying by a constant, and for <m>x^n</m>

    What is the derivative of linear combination <m>af(x)+bg(x)</m> where <m>a,b</m> are constants and <m>f(x), g(x)</m> are functions?

    <title>Product Rule and Quotient Rule</title>
    <p>
     Now we will state and apply formulas for the derivative of a product or a quotient. </p>

    <title>Derivative of Exponentials </title>
    <p>
    In this video we will state how to compute the derivative of the exponential function <m>e^x</m>. Note that I only illustrate this as reasonable graphically, which is not a proof! We'll provide a more precise definition of the exponential function and derive this in the future.
