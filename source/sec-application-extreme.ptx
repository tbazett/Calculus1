    <title>Absolute vs Relative Extrema</title>
    <p>
     In this video we come up with definitions for the notions of absolute and relative maximums and minimums and visualize this with graphs of functions. </p>

    AWhat kinds of polynomials have an absolute max or min on the real numbers? What about on a closed interval like [0,1]? We'll answer that latter question more clearly during class.</p>

    <title>Finding Relative Extrema</title>
    <p>
     Now we turn to the question of how to find a maximum or minimum. We will define a concept called the critical point which provides a necessary condition to be a max or min.

    If f(x) is not defined at x = c, could c be a critical number?</p>

    <title>Concavity and the 2nd Derivative Test</title>
    <p>
      The concavity of a function can be determined using the second derivative test. If the second derivative is positive at a critical point, the function is concave up and the critical point is a relative minimum. If the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down and the critical point is a relative maximum.We have previously seen how the first derivative told us intervals where a function was increasing and decreasing. Now we look to what the second derivative can tell us, a property we refer to as concavity.

    Both the 1st and 2nd derivative provide us information about whether a critical point is a max or min. Which method do you prefer? Do you always prefer it, or does it depend?</p>
