  <title>Video 1: The Velocity Problem</title>

    <p>In this module, we're going to introduce one of the core motivating questions of calculus: How to find the slope of a tangent line? We'll see in particular that one reason why we might care about this problem is a natural question about what is the velocity at a moment in time. These videos will motivate the study of <em>limits</em> which we'll tackle first, then we will return to this same motivation question in the future to finally answer it fully with the notion of <em>derivatives</em></p>

    <title>The Velocity Problem Numerically </title>
    <p>If I know my location at two different times, what is my velocity? There are two different notions to consider: average velocity - over an interval - and instantaneous velocity - at a point. </p>

    <p>We numerically and graphically investigate what happens as we approach the interesting point. Through this, we define the notion of a limit.</p>
    <title>Video 2:  The Velocity Problem: Graphically</title>
    <p>Given a distance vs time plot, the average velocity over an interval is the same as the slope of the secant line between those two points. But taking smaller and smaller intervals near a point, the slopes of these secant lines approach the instantaneous velocity. </p>

    Draw a different curve than I drew, and sketch your own visual of the limit of secant lines approaching a tangent line at a specific point.
