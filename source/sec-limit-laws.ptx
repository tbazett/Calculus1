    <title>Video 1:  Limit Laws</title>
    <p>This video introduces several Limit Laws, their intuition, and why we have to carefully check the conditions of the laws.</p>

    <p>The formulas alone in the Limit Laws in the video aren't ALWAYS true. What are the important condition(s) to check for them to apply?</p>

    <title>Video 2: Limits of Rational Functions</title>
    <p>This video applies the Limit Laws of video 1 to deduce how to quickly compute the limit of a rational function when the denominator is nonzero.</p>

    <title>Post-video reflection</title>
    <p>For a rational function, what is the key thing to check before we just "plug the value in" and say that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)</m>?</p>

    <p>Why does the squeeze theorem not apply to the first limit <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0^+}\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)</m> which we concluded Does Not Exist (DNE)?</p>

      When can you just "plug in" the value you are taking the limit towards, and when do you have to apply an algebraic trick? What features in the expression would you use to decide which algebraic trick might apply?
