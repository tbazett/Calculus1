    <title>Infinite Limits</title>
    <p>
      In this video we discuss limits at infinity for the function <m>\arctan(x)</m> and <m>e^x</m>. We are both learning about limits at infinity as well as building our familiarity with these two important functions in calculus.

    <p>
      In this video we talked about expressions like <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L</m> 
      and in contrast, in class you might have seen <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=\infty</m>. 
      What is the difference between these two concepts?

    <title>Limits at Infinity for Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
     For many functions f(x) such as the rational function we see in this video, we can use some algebra to determine the value of the limit at infinity.

      For a rational function, what is the key thing to check before we just "plug the value in" and say that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)</m>?
