    <title>Video 1: Continuous Functions and Four Types of Discontinuities</title>
    <p>
      This video introduces the intuitive notion of continuity, the precise definition, and describes four types of discontinuities.

      Think about all the common functions you can name, such as <m>tan(x)</m>. Where are each of them continuous?

    <p>
      When our functions are piecewise defined, we need to be particularly careful about checking continuity at the point where the definition changes.  </p>

    <title>Post-video reflection</title>
    <p> Suppose the definition of the piecewise defined function changes at a values <m>x=a</m>. Is <m>a</m> the <em>only</em> spot you need to check for continuity, or do you need to still check the rest?

      <li>
        We use IVT (without thinking about it) all the time in our lives, just like with the claim “you were once 3 feet tall.” What is another everyday statement you might say to someone who doesn't know calculus but is implicitly using IVT?
      </li>
      <li>
        We didn't prove IVT – and we won't in class either. The theorem depends on a key property of the real numbers called “completeness” which in essence is about the idea that the real numbers don't have any holes. We'll talk about this a lot if you take Math 236 Real Analysis in the future!
