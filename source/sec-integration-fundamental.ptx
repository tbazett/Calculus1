    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus I</title>
    <p>
    This video covers the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus I. It considers an accumulation function <m>\int_0^xf(t)dt</m>
 and studies what the rate of change (with respect to x) of such a function is.   </p>

   <fact>
    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II</title>
    <p>
    This video covers the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II, which relates the key idea of anti-derivatives that we have studied previously to integration. It turns out if you know an anti-derivative, then you can compute a definite integral. </p>
