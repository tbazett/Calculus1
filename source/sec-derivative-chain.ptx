    <title>Chain Rule Introduction</title>
    <p>
     In this video we review composition of functions and then use the Chain Rule to compute derivatives of compositions.</p>

    <p>
    Suppose you had a double composition like <m>f(g(h(x)))</m>. Apply the Chain Rule twice in a row to figure out the derivative of this.

    <title>Chain Rule Leibniz Notation</title>
    <p>It is sometimes more convenient - particularly in applied problems with lots of variables coming from, say, physics - to use Leibniz notation to express the derivative of a composition. Let's see the notation and do an applied example.

    When I did the applied example, did the top and bottom dv just cancel?
