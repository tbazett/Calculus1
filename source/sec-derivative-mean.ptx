    <title>Mean Value Theorem</title>
    <p>In this video we introduce one of the most important theorems in calculus: the Mean Value Theorem. This theorem connects a local property (the derivative) to a global property (the slope over an interval). We will see examples showing the necessity of the assumptions in this theorem.

     Can you come up with a counterexample to the theorem in the case where f(x) was continuous only on the open interval (a,b) and not the closed interval [a,b]?</p>
