  <title>How to use these modules</title>

  <p> These video modules are intended to be watched before each class. The videos are introductions to each topic, and are meant to help you feel ready and prepared for class. The videos do not include many of the details and more complicated examples that we will see in class, which is why they are meant as a supplement but not a replacement for class.   </p>

  <p> Caveats: These videos were recorded at my (Trefor) prior institution for a similar but slightly different flavour of calculus class. I've tried to note notational differences if and when they occur, but you should place the conventions from class over that of the videos.  </p>


<p> <em>Notes about YouTube</em>: Videos in this book come from the <url href="https://www.youtube.com/@drtreforuvic">@DrTreforUVic </url> YouTube channel and are not monetized and contain no calls-to-action (ex: "Like and Subscribe"). However, YouTube will unfortunately nevertheless play ads on unmonetized videos occasionally. I additionally and separately have a larger public YouTube channel that contains most of the same videos, but those videos often will have calls-to-action and are monetized. It is thus recomended that any UVic student exclusively use the version of the videos linked in this video textbook.</p>
