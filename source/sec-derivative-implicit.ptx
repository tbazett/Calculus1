    <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>
    <p>
     So far we've taken derivative of functions like <m>f(x)=x^2</m>. But what about computing <m>dy/dx</m> when given an equation like <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>? To do this we will use implicit differentiation.</p>

    A circle visually looks nice and round and smooth. Can we compute the derivative at every single point on the circle in that case?</p>

    <p>
     Inverse trigonometry functions satisfy equations such as <m>\tan(\arctan(x))=x</m>. We can thus use implicit differentiation to find their derivatives.

    Note carefully that we have to be very careful about domains of inverse trig functions, a detail not yet explored in the above video but we will explore this more in class. Can you predict what the issue is going to be?</p>
