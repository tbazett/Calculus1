    <title>Linear Approximation</title>
    <p>If we look at a function (in particular a nice differentiable one) nearby a point, the function can be approximated using the tangent line. In this video we will use our knowledge of derivatives to estimate the values of functions around a point.</p>

    Why did we choose x=1 as our point to approximate by? Would it have been reasonable to choose something else like x=1.3 or x=9?</p>
