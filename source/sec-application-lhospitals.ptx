    <title>L'Hospital's Rule</title>
    <p>
    We've previously spent a lot of effort studying limits of the form 0/0 via algebraic tricks like factoring or common denominators. Now we learn how to leverage our knowledge of derivatives and the incredibly powerful L'Hôpital's Rule. </p>

    <title>L'Hospital's Rule for other indeterminate forms</title>
    <p>
    We can't directly apply L'Hôpital's Rule to indeterminate forms like <m>1^{\infty}</m>. But that's what logarithms are for!
