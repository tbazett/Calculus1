    <title>U-substitution</title>
    <p>
    Finding antiderivatives "undoes" differentiation. So what happens when you undo Chain Rule, which was a rule about differentiation? You get u-substitution, and it will unlock way more integrands for us than we could do before.  </p>

    <title>U-substitution second example</title>
    <p>
    Let's see another example. </p>

   <fact>
    <title>Back Substitution</title>
    <p>
    Sometimes our integrands are a little trickier, and the u-substitution doesn't clean up everything immediately. We can use back susbtitution to clean up the rest of the integrand. 
    <alert> Typo: 5:52 should be (u-2)^2+4 as opposed to (u-2)^2-4. Challenge: Work out the rest of the problem based on that change!</alert>

    <title>U-substitution for Definite Integrals</title>
    <p>
    If you have a definite integral, you can still use u-substitution but you need to be careful about handling the limits of integration.
