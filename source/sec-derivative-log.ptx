    <title>Derivative of ln(x)</title>
    <p>
     In this video we use implicit differentiation to compute the derivative of <m>\ln(x)</m>, defined as the inverse to the exponential function <m>e^x</m>. </p>

    <title>Logarithmic Differentiation</title>
    <p>
    We can leverage the rules of logarithms to simplify the computation of many derivatives, in particular ones of the form <m>f(x)^{g(x)}</m></p>

    <title>Post-video reflection</title>
    <p>
    In the above video we saw the original expression <m>x^{\sin(x)}</m> appear in the answer. If you start with <m>f(x)^{g(x)}</m> do you think that <m>f(x)^{g(x)}</m> will always appear in the derivative when using logarithmic differentiation? </p>
